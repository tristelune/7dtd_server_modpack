C# Modlets (cannot be server only, EAC must be off!!!).

15 Slot Toolbelt - Increases the toolbelt to 15 slots.

Extra Tool And Output Slots - This is mostly for other modders. It increases the maximum amount of tools a workstation can have to 6 (so stops duplicating anything after slot 3) and the maximum output slots to 12 (was 6).

Larger FOV - Increases the max FOV to 150, though anything above 90 is a bit distorted. Might be good for folks with motion sickness.

Vehicle Damage Patch - Increases the amount of damage a zombie takes when you run it over. Amount of damage depends on how heavy the vehicle is and how fast you hit the zombie.

Vehicle Sound Fix - This is more for modders. It fixes that horrible noise when driving custom vehicles.

Wandering Horde Frequency - Folks may know this from JaWoodle's "Anywhere, Anytime" series. It creates random wandering hordes, of a random amount of zombies, a random amount of times per day. How often (in terms of in-game hours) and how many zombies are configurable in the blocks.xml included in the modlet.

Zombie Fall Damage - Removes the cap on the amount of damage zombies take when falling from heights, so drop pits from older alphas are now a semi-valid form of defense.
